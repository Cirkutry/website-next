# EssentialsX Website
This repository contains the source code for the EssentialsX website, which 
is hosted at [essentialsx.net](https://essentialsx.net).

This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), 
[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), 
and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

## Development
While possible to use any package manager, this project is set up to use 
[bun](https://bun.sh/), a modern, superfast package manager and JavaScript runtime.

To get started, [install bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation), clone this
repository, and run `bun install` in the project directory.

To start the development server, run `bun dev`. The website will be available
at `http://localhost:3000` and will automatically reload when you make changes.
